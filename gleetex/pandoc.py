"""This module contains functionality to parse formulas from a given Pandoc
document AST and to replace these through formatted HTML equations.

It works in these parsses:

1.  Extract all math elements from the Pandoc AST.
2.  Convert all formulas to images
    *   LaTeX is the slowest bit in this process, therefore the formulas are
        collected and then converted in parallel.
3.  Replace all math tags in the pandoc AST by raw HTML inline formatting
    instructions that reference the converted images and position them
    correctly. Note that this cannot made HTML-independent because of the
    requirement to use vertical alignment that is not supported by the Pandoc
    AST and is hence expressed as a CSS styling instruction.
